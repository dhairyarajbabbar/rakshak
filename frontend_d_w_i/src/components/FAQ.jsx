              In my previous projects, I encountered various challenges such as scalability issues, tight deadlines, and evolving requirements. To address these challenges, I leveraged my problem-solving skills and collaborated closely with team members to brainstorm innovative solutions. For example, in one project, we implemented microservices architecture to improve scalability, and in another, we adopted Agile methodologies to adapt to changing requirements effectively.
